My name is David Ayrton

I am currently employed as a network engineer and have been in IT since 2015

In my current role I am involved in world wide network operations and have been heavily focused on Arista technologies -  specifically around AVD (Arista Validaed Designs), CVP (Cloud vision Portal), and open standard EVPN/VXLAN. I really enjoy troubleshooting networks the fulfilment that comes from solving problems.
